Revision history for Perl module Net::Server::POP3

0.0005
        - Started proxytest.pl, a slightly more involved sample script
          than simpletest.pl
0.0004    2004 March 08
        - Minor improvements to the documentation.  Attempted to make
          the documentation on CPAN link to the simpletest.pl script
          (not sure how that'll turn out).
        - Started keeping track of changes (in this file you're reading).
        - Fixed minor package scope bug introduced in 0.0003.
0.0003    Feb 13 11:15    2004
        - Abstracted network line endings to a $EOL variable until I
          figure out how to make this work on all platforms and Perl
          versions.
        - Fixed a fencepost error in the delete code that was not
          exercised by simpletest.pl but was discovered and reported
          by Christian Neeb.
0.0002    Jan 25 16:50    2004
        - first version to be indexed by the indexer, so you can find
          it on search.cpan.org (0.0001 was not indexed, because it
          did not unpack into a single directory).  Minimal changes.
          The version number inside POP3.pm was not incremented as
          it should have been, so may show up as 0.0001
0.0001    Jan 24 19:04    2004
        - first version uploaded to CPAN.  Very early version, totally incomplete.
0.0000    Dec 30 16:49:29 2003
	- original version; created by ExtUtils::ModuleMaker 0.32
