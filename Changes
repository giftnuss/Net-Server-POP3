Revision history for Perl module Net::Server::POP3

* denotes changes that break backward compatibility.

0.0006    2004 May 19
        - EOL can now be passed to new() or startserver() at runtime,
          so that editing POP3.pm is not necessary just to change
          $EOL.  (I still need to actually _fix_ this bug...)
        - DEBUG can also be passed to new() or startserver() to set
          the desired level of debug output at runtime.
        - The client's IP address is now passed to the authenticate
          callback, as documented.
        - Various improvements to the POD, for consistency and
          accuracy and clarity.  I think the bug list now has
          everything I know about.  The description now actually
          describes what the module does, in addition to warning
          that the code is not release quality.  Also, I've labelled
          the code "beta" rather than "alpha" although there are still
          sundry things unimplemented.
        - Updated the Todo list (woo).

        * The size callback is now passed the username and the message
          id, for consistency with the other callbacks.  Note that
          this change breaks backward-compatibility for the size
          callback.  simpletest.pl was updated to handle this change.
        - Included proxytest.pl, a slightly more involved sample script
          than simpletest.pl.  Thanks to Galion Public Library for
          this better sample script.  When you get mail from it, it
          gets the mail from your ISP's mailserver on the fly, using
          Mail::POP3Client.  A more advanced proxy that does
          cacheing and preretrieval is planned for a future release.
        - Updated the POD to reflect these changes.
        - Fixed (hopefully) the link to the sample script in the POD
          (note to self:  variables don't interpolate in POD), and
          added a link to the new sample script also.
        - Removed most of what was left of the stub documentation.
        - Minor change to simpletest.pl to generate better message IDs
          in the test messages.  (Why?  Umm, because.)
        - Added tests to check that the module loads under Taint mode.

        - Minor improvements to the documentation.  Attempted to make
          the documentation on CPAN link to the simpletest.pl script
          (not sure how that'll turn out).
        - Started keeping track of changes (in this file you're reading).
        - Fixed minor package scope bug introduced in 0.0003.

        - Abstracted network line endings to a $EOL variable until I
          figure out how to make this work on all platforms and Perl
          versions.
        - Fixed a fencepost error in the delete code that was not
          exercised by simpletest.pl but was discovered and reported
          by Christian Neeb.

        - first version to be indexed by the indexer, so you can find
          it on search.cpan.org (0.0001 was not indexed, because it
          did not unpack into a single directory).  Minimal changes.
          The version number inside POP3.pm was not incremented as
          it should have been, so may show up as 0.0001
0.0001    Jan 24 19:04    2004
        - first version uploaded to CPAN.  Very early version, totally incomplete.
0.0000    Dec 30 16:49:29 2003
	- original version; created by ExtUtils::ModuleMaker 0.32
